# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository contains only the Silo Android clients. Shared Kotlin logic lives in `shared/`, Android-only playback and UI helpers live in `android-shared/`, the phone app lives in `androidApp/`, and the TV app lives in `androidTvApp/`. Android playback notes live in `docs/media3/`; utility scripts live in `scripts/`.

## Current Product Exposure

- Ebooks/Reading are phone-only. Do not expose ebooks or Reading on Android TV.
- Android mobile navigation is Home, Libraries, For You, Calendar, and Downloads only when the active profile has downloads. Video, Audio, and Reading are library modes reached through Libraries, not bottom-nav tabs.
- Android TV navigation is Home, available media-type tabs from server libraries, Calendar, search, and profile actions. Reading/ebooks are excluded.
- Requests, Admin, and Watch Together are not currently accessible on Android phone or Android TV. Code paths may exist, but do not document them as live features or add them to menus without an explicit product decision.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug` builds the Android phone APK.
- `./gradlew :androidTvApp:assembleDebug` builds the Android TV APK.
- `./gradlew :androidApp:installDebug` installs the phone app on a connected emulator or device.
- `./gradlew :androidTvApp:installDebug` installs the TV app on a connected emulator or device.
- `./gradlew test` runs available Kotlin/JUnit tests.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use Kotlin 2.1, Java 21 targets, and Compose idioms. The Silo package root is `org.siloserver.silo`. Both the phone and TV apps share a single `applicationId`, `org.siloserver.silo`, so they publish as one Google Play listing (Play routes each build by manifest feature filtering — the phone build requires `android.hardware.touchscreen`; the TV build requires `android.software.leanback`). The Gradle `namespace` stays distinct per module (`org.siloserver.silo.android`, `org.siloserver.silo.tv`) so generated `R`/`BuildConfig` classes don't collide. The two artifacts use distinct versionCodes (`base*2` for phone, `base*2+1` for TV), so each release bumps both by 2 with no reuse; bump `siloVersionCode` per release. This repo is on the full Silo namespace cut, so do not add legacy package IDs, legacy storage names, or old-brand symbols. Kotlin classes and composables use `PascalCase`; functions and properties use `camelCase`.

## Testing Guidelines

Android tests use Kotlin test/JUnit where present, especially under `android-shared/src/androidUnitTest`. Do not add tests for small changes or UI changes unless requested. For shared logic changes, add focused tests only for critical or high-risk behavior.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit local SDK overrides, signing material, logs, tool state, generated build output, or media fixtures. A running Silo server is required for realistic auth, browsing, and playback validation.
